## About Me ##
<font size=3> I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://science.ai.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">AI for Science Institute</a> at Cornell University, working with Prof. <a href="https://www.peese.org/professor/" target="_blank">Fengqi You</a>. Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences</a> (IIIS) at Tsinghua University in 2025, advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.wuchenye.cn/" target="_blank">Chenye Wu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/People/Faculty/DuanRan.htm" target="_blank">Ran Duan</a>. I was a visiting student researcher at the <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Computing + Mathematical Sciences</a> (CMS) Department, Caltech from Aug. 2023 to Mar. 2024, advised by Prof. <a href="https://adamwierman.com/" target="_blank">Adam Wierman</a>. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science & Technology in 2020. </font>

## Research Interests ##
<font size=3> 

<p>My research lies at the intersection of reinforcement learning, stochastic optimization, and robust control, with a focus on sustainable energy and computing systems. </p>

Theoretically, I aim to develop reinforcement learning algorithms that leverage problem-specific structures for enhancing sample efficiency and providing rigorous safety guarantees, which can enable their deployment in data-limited and safety-critical environments. 

Practically, I apply these designed methods to the online operation of complex networked systems: (i) designing efficient and reliable scheduling algorithms for power grids to enhance the stability and sustainability of global energy supply, and (ii) optimizing energy–computation co-scheduling in large-scale data centers to achieve globally efficient energy–AI integration.
