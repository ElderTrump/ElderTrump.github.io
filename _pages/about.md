## About Me ##
<font size=3>I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.wuchenye.cn/" target="_blank">Chenye Wu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=E1abJLQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Ran Duan</a>. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science & Technology.</font>  <font size=3>I was  a visiting student researcher at the Computing + Mathematical Sciences (CMS) Department, Caltech from Aug. 2023 to Mar. 2024, advised by Prof. <a href="https://adamwierman.com/" target="_blank">Adam Wierman</a>. I also collaborate closely with Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/zaiweichen/home" target="_blank">Zaiwei Chen</a> at Purdue IE, Prof. <a href="https://wei-qi-home.github.io/" target="_blank">Wei Qi</a> at Tsinghua IE, and Dr. <a href="https://laixishi.github.io/" target="_blank">Laixi Shi</a> at Caltech CMS. </font>

## Research Interests ##
<font size=3> 
My research interests lie broadly in learning, optimization, control and power systems. I focus on developing data-efficient and robust decision-making frameworks with provable performance guarantees by leveraging task-dependent structures and information. In application, I aim to address the challenges of power and energy system operations in time-varying, safety-critical environments, contributing to scalable, adaptive, and sustainable solutions. </font>
