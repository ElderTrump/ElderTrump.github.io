## About Me ##
<font size=3> I'm an Eric & Windy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://science.ai.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">AI for Science Institute</a> at Cornell University, working with Prof. <a href="https://www.peese.org/professor/" target="_blank">Fengqi You</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences</a> (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.wuchenye.cn/" target="_blank">Chenye Wu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/People/Faculty/DuanRan.htm" target="_blank">Ran Duan</a>. Before that, I was a visiting student researcher at the <a href="https://www.cms.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Computing + Mathematical Sciences</a>(CMS) Department, Caltech from Aug. 2023 to Mar. 2024, advised by Prof. <a href="https://adamwierman.com/" target="_blank">Adam Wierman</a>. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science & Technology in 2020. </font>

## Research Interests ##
<font size=3> 

<p><b>AI Empowers Energy; Energy Sustains AI</b>.</p>

<p>My research lies at the intersection of AI and Energy, with broad interests in reinforcement learning, stochastic optimization, control, and sustainable energy systems. I focus on the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of online decision-making in large-scale networked systems, with applications in two complementary directions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>AI for Energy</b>: Developing learning-based optimization and control methods for the scalable, reliable, and safe operation of power grids.</li>
  <li><b>Energy for AI</b>: Designing multi-scale scheduling algorithms to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of large-scale AI infrastructures, such as data centers.</li>
</ul>
