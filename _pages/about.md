## About Me ##
<font size=3>I recently received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.wuchenye.cn/" target="_blank">Chenye Wu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/People/Faculty/DuanRan.htm" target="_blank">Ran Duan</a>. Before that, I was a visiting student researcher at the Computing + Mathematical Sciences (CMS) Department, Caltech from Aug. 2023 to Mar. 2024, advised by Prof. <a href="https://adamwierman.com/" target="_blank">Adam Wierman</a>. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science & Technology. I will be joining Cornell University as a Postdoctoral Fellow this Fall. </font>

## Research Interests ##
<font size=3> 
My research focuses on AI + Energy, with broad interests in energy systems, reinforcement learning, and control. I work on the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of decision-making in large-scale networked systems, with a dual focus on (1) AI for Energy:
Designing scalable, learning-based optimization frameworks for large-scale power grid control, addressing challenges in real-time, uncertain, and safety-critical environments. (2) Energy for AI: Developing energy-aware algorithms to manage and optimize the operation of networked AI infrastructure (like data center), balancing energy, latency, and reliability in sustainable computing. </font>
