## About Me ##
<font size=3>I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS) at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.wuchenye.cn/" target="_blank">Chenye Wu</a>. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Software Engineering from Huazhong University of Science & Technology.</font>  <font size=3>I was  a visiting student researcher at the Computing + Mathematical Sciences (CMS) Department, Caltech from Aug. 2023 to Mar. 2024, advised by Prof. <a href="https://adamwierman.com/" target="_blank">Adam Wierman</a>. I'm an incoming postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University this Fall. </font>

## Research Interests ##
<font size=3> 
My research focuses on AI for Sustainability, with broad interests in reinforcement learning, optimization, control, and power systems. I develop data-efficient and robust learning and optimization algorithms with provable performance guarantees, leveraging task-dependent structures and information. My work aims to address the challenges of power and energy system operations in time-varying, safety-critical environments, contributing to scalable, adaptive, and sustainable solutions. </font>
